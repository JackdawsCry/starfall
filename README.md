 The focus of our game is to teach students how to balance their busy lives to ensure that they can maintain good physical health, mental health, and keep up their academics. The different levels of the game will help students learn about different mental illnesses and how to cope with them, easy ways to stay physically healthy, and tips on how to behave in a social situation.
